## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`4 - Exploring Pokemon Data.ipynb`). In this Notebook, we explore a dataset containing information about 890 known Pokemon until the 8th Generation. The dataset includes various attributes such as pokedex_number, name, type_1, type_2, hp, attack, defense, and many more. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better and visualize the data using pandas and matplotlib.


## Dataset
The dataset is provided as a .csv file named pokemon.csv. It contains 1028 observations (rows) across 48 variables (columns). Each variable provides specific information about the Pokemon, such as their types, stats, abilities, and more.
